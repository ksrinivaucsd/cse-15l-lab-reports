**Step 4**

I logged into ieng6 by pressing the keys 

~~~
ssh cs15lfa23dg@ieng6.ucsd.edu<Enter>
~~~

I already had the public key set up so I did not have to press more keys to enter the passcode.

I typed in *vim L* <Tab> and . <Tab> and <Enter> to enter ListExamples.java.

I pressed the <down> 41 times and the <right> 11 times. I then pressed <x>, followed by <i>, and then <2>.

**Step 9**

I typed *git add --all* and <Enter>. Followed by *git commit -m "changes lab4"* and <Enter>. Followed by *git push* and <Enter>.

There was nothing to commit as I had already committed these changes before during lab and forgot to take a screenshot.
